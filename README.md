## Course Description :owl:

**[Git](https://git-scm.com)** is an open source **version control system** for
tracking changes in code and other types of text documents. First released in
2005, Git has become the **de-facto standard** for version control, and is
extensively used in both open source and commercial software development.

Git is not limited to software development, and has proved to be an essential
tool in **reproducible research** - allowing to keep track of files such as
data analysis scripts, pipelines, reports or more generally any text-based
document.

This one-day course gives a short **introduction to Git** and its most useful
commands, as well as an introduction to collaborative workflows using GitHub
through both theory and practical exercises.

Specifically, **the course will cover the following topics**:

* **Git basics:** creating a Git repository, making commits, and displaying a
  repository's history.
* **Git concepts:** commits, the HEAD pointer and the Git index.
* **Git branches:** introduction to branched workflows and collaborative
  workflow examples.
**Branch management:** create and merge branches.
**Working with remotes:** collaborating with Git and GitHub.

Please note that this course focuses exclusively on using Git via
**command line**, but this knowledge is easily transferrable to any GUI
environment (e.g. VS Code, RStudio, etc.).
